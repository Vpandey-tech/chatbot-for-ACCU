Mechanical engineering is a discipline that applies the principles of physics and materials science
for the design, analysis, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It's one of the oldest
and broadest engineering disciplines.

Key areas of mechanical engineering include:
1. Thermodynamics and heat transfer
2. Structural analysis and mechanics of materials
3. Kinematics and dynamics
4. Fluid mechanics
5. Manufacturing and production engineering
6. Machine design
7. Control systems and instrumentation
8. HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning)
9. Automotive and aerospace engineering
10. Robotics and mechatronics

Common engineering equations and principles include:
- Newton's Laws of Motion
- Conservation of Energy, Mass, and Momentum
- Thermodynamic Laws
- Fluid Dynamics Equations (Bernoulli's, Navier-Stokes)
- Stress-Strain Relationships
- Heat Transfer Equations
- Material Properties
